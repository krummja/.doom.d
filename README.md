# About Emacs

Emacs changes how you *think* about programming.

Emacs is **totally introspectable**. You can always find out &rsquo;what code runs when I press this button?&rsquo;.

Emacs is an **incremental programming environment**. There&rsquo;s no edit-compile-run cycle. There isn&rsquo;t even an edit-run cycle. You can execute snippets of code and gradually turn them into a finished project. There&rsquo;s no distinction between your editor and your interpreter.

Emacs is a **mutable environment**. You can set variables, tweak functions with advice, or redefine entire functions. Nothing is off-limits.

Emacs provides **functionality without applications**. Rather than separate applications, functionality is all integrated into your Emacs instance. Amazingly, this works. Ever wanted to use the same snippet tool for writing C++ classes as well as emails?

Emacs is full of **incredible software concepts that haven&rsquo;t hit the mainstream yet**. For example:

-   Many platforms have a single item clipboard. Emacs has an **infinite clipboard**.
-   If you undo a change, and then continue editing, you can&rsquo;t redo the original change. Emacs allows **undoing to any historical state**, even allowing tree-based exploration of history.
-   Emacs supports a **reverse variable search**: you can find variables with a given value.
-   You can perform **structural editing** of code, allowing you to make changes without breaking syntax. This works for lisps (paredit) and non-lisps (smartparens).
-   Many applications use a modal GUI: for example, you can&rsquo;t do other edits during a find-and-replace operation. Emacs provides **recursive editing** that allow you to suspend what you&rsquo;re currently doing, perform other edits, then continue the original task.

Emacs has a **documentation culture**. Emacs includes a usage manual, a lisp programming manual, pervasive docstrings and even an interactive tutorial.

Emacs has a **broad ecosystem**. If you want to edit code in a niche language, there&rsquo;s probably an Emacs package for it.

Emacs doesn&rsquo;t have a monopoly on good ideas, and there are other great tools out there. Nonetheless, we believe the [Emacs learning curve](https://i.stack.imgur.com/7Cu9Z.jpg) pays off.

# About Doom-Emacs

Doom is a configuration framework for [GNU Emacs 26.3+](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) tailored for Emacs bankruptcy veterans who want less framework in their frameworks and the performance of a hand rolled config (or better). It can be a foundation for your own config or a resource for Emacs enthusiasts to learn more about our favorite OS.

Doom is an opinionated collection of reasonable (and optional) defaults with a focus on performance (both runtime and startup) and on abstraction-light, readable code design, so that there is less between you and Emacs.
